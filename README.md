### Introduction:
This is the repository for IERG4210 Project, the project has came to an end and this repo will be archived and made public solely intended for referencing by myself / in contribute to my profile. 
I am not responsible for results of any usage outside the forementioned purpose.
This branch is responsible for the final submitted coding, again, I provide no guarantee over the correctless and usability of the code reside in this repo, and would not provide support in any terms under all circumstances.

### Security Related Note:
As you can probably see, the key, salt. pepper is not masked or redacted and I had them in plaintext w/ the code I provided, the reason behind is that this repo is made solely for purpose of project for an academic course provided by my university and the cloud server repsonsible for hosting has been taken down after evaluation period, __You are discouraged in reusing whole part and/or any part of the code provided in any form of production environment, services that requires any form of reliability or similar projects, I am not responsible for any results that happens with relation to my code.__ It is also worth noting that all service APIs has been closed/terminated, All the exposed URL, Key, salt etc. are nothing more then random string of gibberish at this moment.

### Word at end:
I am uncertain whether which path i would settle on, in fact at first I had no thought in archiving this on Github, but at least now I have a place to host code that i typed and efforts I spent. Again, although I wholeheartly discourage the use of the hosted code in any environment as they maybe bugged in their own way, I am still pleased if it could be of any help.
